WEEK - 1
Skill: Data Structures and Algorithms
Exercise 2: Financial Forecasting (Recursive)

RECURSIVE

Time Complexity: O(n) - 1 recursive call for each year.

Space Complexity: O(n) – due to call stack memory.


OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
1. ITERATION

Time Complexity: O(n) - 1 iteration for each year.

Space Complexity: O(1) – Constant space.

2. DP / Closed-form Formulation

Time and Space Complexity: O(1)
