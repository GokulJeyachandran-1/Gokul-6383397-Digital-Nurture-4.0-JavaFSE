1. Bubble Sort	
Time Complexity: O(n²)	
Space Complexity: O(1)	
Simple but inefficient for large n.

2. Quick Sort	
Time Complexity: 
	Average: O(n log n), 
	Worst: O(n²) worst	
Space Complexity: O(log n)	
Fast and preferred in practice.

Since Quick sort is faster, it is usually preferred over Bubble sort.
