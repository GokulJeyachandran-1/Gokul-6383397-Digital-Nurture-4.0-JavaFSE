Operations and their Time Complexity	

Add Product	- O(1) HashMap put() - constant time on average
Update Product - O(1)	get() + set() - constant time
Delete Product - O(1)	remove() - constant time
Display All - O(n)	Iterates through all (n) products

Optimization tip:
1. HashMap - for faster look ups
2. TreeMap - for sorted view
