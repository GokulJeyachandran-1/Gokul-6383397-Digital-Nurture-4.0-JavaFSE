1. BINARY SEARCH
Condition: Array must be sorted (sorting cost = O(n log n) if not pre-sorted).

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) - Target found at the mid-point.
Average Case: O(log n) - Each step eliminates half the search space.
Worst Case: O(log n) - Target not found after all divisions.

Space Complexity:
Iterative: O(1)
Recursive: O(log n) â€“ due to recursive stack frames.

2. LINEAR SEARCH
Condition: No sorting required.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) - Target found at the first index.
Average Case: O(n) - Target in the middle (on average).
Worst Case: O(n) - Target at the end or not present.

Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place search so, no additional memory.
